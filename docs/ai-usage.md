# AI usage log

What the agent (Claude Code) did, what had to be corrected, and what failed. Raw counts, not impressions: this is the evidence for H7 and H8 in [`workflow-playbook-v0.md`](../workflow-playbook-v0.md), and part of H9.

**Result** is one of: *right first time* · *corrected by tool* (a linter, test or check caught it) · *corrected by owner* · *failed* · *pending review* (the owner has not reviewed it yet; updated at the gate).
**Type** is one of: research · spec/docs · tooling · code · test · asset · ops.

## Stage 1 — requirements and success metrics

| # | Date | Task | Type | Result | Caught by | What was corrected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2026-10-21 | Find the Stage 1 instructions. The playbook gives one table row; the detailed "Claude Code prompt v2" it mentions is not on disk. Read the previous projects (Su-30 `CLAUDE.md`, portfolio `AI-WORKFLOW.md` and spec 02) for conventions | research | right first time | — | — (logged as risk R14) |
| 2 | 2026-10-21 | Read the model's metadata only (the full analysis is Stage 2): license CC BY-SA 4.0, the open book is a single mesh, the lens uses transmission | research | pending review | — | — |
| 3 | 2026-10-21 | Check the Contentstack Free plan on contentstack.com/pricing: limits found; locales, environments, webhooks and Live Preview not listed | research | pending review | — | — (logged as risk R07) |
| 4 | 2026-10-21 | Choose tool versions (≥ 14 days old, by release date). ESLint rejected: typescript-eslint 8.71.1 supports TypeScript `<6.1.0` only | tooling | right first time | — | — (ADR 0001) |
| 5 | 2026-10-21 | Write `biome.json` | tooling | corrected by tool | Biome deprecation notice | Used `linter.rules.recommended`, deprecated in Biome 2.5; migrated to `preset` with `biome migrate` |
| 6 | 2026-10-21 | First format run of the new TypeScript files | code | corrected by tool | `biome ci` (3 errors) | Lines over the 100-column limit in 3 files; fixed with `biome check --write` |
| 7 | 2026-10-21 | Traceability checker and exact-version checker, with 16 unit tests | code | right first time | — | Also checked against a deliberately broken copy of the specs: all 5 planted problems reported, exit code 1 |
| 8 | 2026-10-21 | Vision spec, traceability table, risk register, ADR 0001, gate summary | spec/docs | pending review | — | — |

### Stage 1 counts

| Measure | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Tasks | 8 |
| Right first time | 3 (research 1, tooling 1, code 1) |
| Corrected by tool | 2 (tooling 1, code 1) |
| Corrected by owner | 0 so far (updated at the gate) |
| Failed | 0 |
| Pending review | 3 |
| Time blocked waiting on the owner (H7) | 0 min: the agent worked on stated assumptions A1–A6 and moved 9 questions to the gate |
